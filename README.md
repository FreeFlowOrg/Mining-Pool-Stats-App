# Mining Pool Stats

This repo contains the code for the app that we at FreeFlow have created for our fellow mining pool miners in order to monitor some stats constantly.<br/>

We'll soon be updating and getting more features on to this app.<br>
We look at making this app a one stop solution for you to check everything about the mining pool.<br>

Incase you want to join the pool, please click ![here](http://107.173.118.210:8080/)

<b>In order to download this apk file for the app to set it up on your phone, please click ![here](https://github.com/FreeFlowOrg/Mining-Pool-Stats-App/releases).</b>

The current version number of the app is <b>v0.0.1</b>
